            <p>
              I've been playing guitar and making music for several years - it's
              my main creative outlet. I love working on coding projects and
              creating video games in my free time, especially when I get to
              explore new tech and tackle new challenges. I'm really interested
              in the intersection of healthcare and technology, always thinking
              about how software can make patient care better and medical
              workflows smoother.
